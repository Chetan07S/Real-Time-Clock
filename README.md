# Real-Time-Clock
The project involved designing a Real Time Clock (RTC) that displays time in the format HH:MM:SS using Verilog HDL. The clock operates in a 24-hour format, automatically handling carry-over from seconds to minutes and from minutes to hours. It also includes a seven-segment display decoder to visualize the time output on digital displays.

The main goal of this project was to create a simple yet functional digital clock model that counts time accurately using clock pulses as input. It provides a foundational understanding of digital timekeeping systems and hardware-based counters.

The design was verified using Xilinx Vivado, where the simulation and elaboration confirmed the correct time incrementation behavior, rollover logic, and proper seven-segment display outputs.
